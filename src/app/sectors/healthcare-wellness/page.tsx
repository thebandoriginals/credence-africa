        <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          <p>We strengthen Africaâ€™s healthcare ecosystem by combining professionalism with entrepreneurial and digital models. Our approach recognizes that healthcare in Africa is not only a service but also a cornerstone of economic and social stability. We link hospitals, clinics, policymakers, insurers, and private investors to design systems that are financially viable, accessible, and patient-centered.</p>
          <p>By addressing financing gaps, fragmented supply chains, workforce shortages, and slow adoption of digital health solutions, we enable healthcare institutions to transition from fragile and donor-dependent models to sustainable, scalable systems of care. We also integrate healthcare with broader development goals, including climate resilience, gender equity, and cooperative-led service delivery.</p>
