        <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          <p>Africa’s nonprofit, philanthropy, and development sector is at a crossroads. For decades, aid has driven programs, but too often it has created dependency, fragmented priorities, and shallow impact. Meanwhile, African societies are grappling with youth unemployment, fragile health systems, climate risks, and governance gaps that require bold, locally led solutions.</p>
          <p>At Credence Africa, we reposition nonprofits, foundations, and social enterprises to move from aid-dependence to enterprise-driven sustainability and systemic influence. We focus on governance, financial resilience, and policy engagement, equipping organizations to align with Africa’s growth agenda and deliver measurable impact at scale.</p>
          <p>Our model builds professional, investable, and trusted institutions — nonprofits that can partner credibly with governments, attract blended capital, and influence national and continental policy priorities.</p>
